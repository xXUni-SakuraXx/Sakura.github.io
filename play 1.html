            <h1>Adopt me is a wonderful game to role-play, You can age pets, <br>
                dress up your avatar and even decorate your house!  If you have <br>
                4 full-grown pets, you can make a neon,(meaning it will have <br>
                 a beautiful bright light,which is going to be a colour that really <br>
                 suits your cute,adorable pet!Once in a while,adopt me will change <br>
                 the type of egg. In adopt me,there are a certain number of eggs. <br>
                 There is a cracked egg($350),the pet egg($600),the royal egg($1450),and the limited egg, <br>
                 which costs $750.The limited egg will change once half a year.Once the current egg <br>
                 is changed,itwill NEVER come back.That means you will have to buy the current egg BEFORE it <br>
                 gets replaced!!!You need to do a certain number of tasks to hatch the egg.The <br>
                 hardest to get is a leg pet.</h1>
