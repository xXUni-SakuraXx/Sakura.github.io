            <h1>A leg pet means its a legendary pet.Players in adopt me say”leg”<br>
                because it takes less time to type it out.This game is made by <br>
                 Uplift.Uplift was used to be named Dreamcraft,but the people <br>
                 who made adopt me changed to name of their group. If  you are <br>
                  new to adopt me and you have robux,i reccomend u to buy fly and <br>
                  ride potions,because like I said,they need robux,so people who  <br>
                  don’t have robux will put good items to trade for your fly or ride <br>
                  potions.You can also think about buying the robux pets.If you <br>
                  don’t have robux,i would like to reccomend you to save up bucks <br>
                   to buy eggs to hatch.It will take a long time to hatch a leg,but <br>
                   your leg pet will apper out of your egg very soon <br>
                   if u work hard!Also,beware of scammers!Some people want <br>
                    good items but they don’t like working hard.That’s why they  <br>
                    think of ideas to scam other people with good pets they like. But <br>
                    if you are not a scammer,please do not change your mind! <br>
                    Always remember,NEVER EVER SCAM ANYONE!!!
